The data was extracted from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and comprises data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.


Note:  Made the assumption that the current column names are descriptive if the enduser works in this particular field.  Since I do not, I was not sure what the names ment and thus could not make them fit terminology non-industry individuals would understand.

First creates a data frame of just the mean and average fields from the raw data set.  This data is used to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject as describe below. All information on the totalDataset fields are at the end of this file.

Tidy Dataset 
Output is average of each

Used "|" out of habit.  Larger numbers sometimes have a comma, so I use "|" as my default separator
